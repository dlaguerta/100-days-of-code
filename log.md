# 100 Days Of Code - Log
#### Start Date: February 6, 2017


### Day 1: June 27, Monday
**What I want to work on**: I want to go back to my github website, review the original CSS, and update it. I also want to add a blog so I can track my work work weekly.

**Today's Progress**: Started learning Golang at Code School, but spent most of my time working on my Github website.

**Thoughts**: Most of my time was spent on reading documentation, and not writing as much code as I hoped. Also looks like I will want to learn SASS.
